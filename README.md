## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this project helped me reinforce my understanding of:

1. **HTML Structure**: Organizing content with semantic elements like `<header>`, `<ul>`, and `<ol>`.
2. **CSS Media Queries**: Creating responsive designs for both small and large screens.
3. **Typography and Color**: Using CSS to apply color schemes and adjust font properties for readability and aesthetics.
4. **Hover and focus**: Using more interactive elements on the page to enhance user experience.

For example, hover and focus states I used:

```html
 <div class="button-div">GitHub</div>
  <div class="button-div">Frontend Mentor</div>
  <div class="button-div">LinkedIn</div>
  <div class="button-div">Twitter</div>
  <div class="button-div">Instagram</div>
  </div>
  ```

```css
.button-div {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    color: hsl(0, 6%, 79%);
    font-size: 18px;
    font-weight: 700;
    margin-top: 20px;
    padding: 20px;
    margin-left: 80px;
    margin-right: 80px;
    margin-bottom: 5px;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
.button-div:hover {
    background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to:

- Experiment more with CSS elements for creative designs.
- Intergrate JavaScript into the pages.
- Work with flexboxes more in the future.
